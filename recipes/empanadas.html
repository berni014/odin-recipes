        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Empanadas are savory pastries filled with a variety of ingredients such as beef, chicken, ham and cheese, or vegetables. They are made with a flaky dough that is folded over the filling and sealed, then baked or fried until golden. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, these hand-held delights are perfect as appetizers, snacks, or even a full meal.</p>
